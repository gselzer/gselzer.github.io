title: Hi, I'm Gabriel Selzer
---

![](./resources/me.jpg)

I'm a Master's student in the [Computer Science](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/) program at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/). I'll be graduating in May 2024, and am actively looking for positions in the Chicago, IL area.

I've been a member of the [Elicieri Lab (LOCI)](https://loci.wisc.edu/) since the summer of 2017, where I've become a member of the ImageJ2/Fiji core team. It is my goal to make scientific computation more accessible to scientists of all technical backgrounds.

When I'm not online, you can find me out on a [disc golf](https://www.pdga.com/news/what-disc-golf-guide-parents-kids) course, [sailing Lake Mendota](https://www.hoofersailing.org/), or at the gym. I'm a diehard Milwaukee Brewers fan, and also love board and video games!

## Projects I'm Proud of
* [SciJava3](https://github.com/scijava/scijava), the next generation of the [SciJava](https://imagej.net/libs/scijava) ecosystem
* [napari-imagej](https://napari.imagej.net), a [napari](https://napari.org/) plugin designed to unify the Python scientific stack with the [ImageJ ecosystem](https://imagej.net).
